## What we achieved in 48 hours

[Android APK](https://github.com/danesjenovdan/humans.vote/blob/master/voter-client/android-debug.apk?raw=true) (An app that basically allows you to do all the things you want to, but we didn't quite have the time to implement the nice user interface. :()

# What do you need to do if you want to try this out

## Step 1: Android application
Download the application from the github repository and install it. After running the application wallet, will be automatically generated for you, and you will be able to execute contract calls after someone gives you ether, or you get it by setting up miner.

## Step 2: Installation instructions - Ubuntu
Because decentralisation also means private networks and mining fees are often prohibitive (yay for PoS!) running private mining networks makes sense when you have a group of intrinsically motivated individuals (like an NGO). In order to vote and interact with contracts "for free", you need to set up your own network. With humans.vote, this is actually a trivial task. Just follow the instructions below.

### Administrator (party official or NGO sysadmin)
#### Bootstrap node
##### Instructions:

* ```apt-get install git```
* ```git clone https://github.com/danesjenovdan/humans.vote.git```
* ```cd humans.vote```
* ```chmod +x setup.sh```
* ```./setup.sh```
* When promted for the IP, enter the IP or domain name of the main party server, where enode information is available.
* When prompted for the wallet address enter your wallet address, that was generated in the mobile application. 
  * This will save any mined resources into your wallet.
  * Private key is not needed for mining into your account, however if you plan to use your node to send resources, voting (sending transactions) or for any other purpose involving use of your wallet you will need to install your private key into eth-data/keystore/.
  * If you do not enter an address one will be automatically generated for you. In this case you will be prompted to enter password for the private key.
 * When prompted if this is main node, enter "y" for yes.
 * When prompted for the organisation name, please enter your organisation name, as it is stored on the blockchain.
* During the installation the following executes:
	* All dependencies are installed
	* Wallet is generated
	* genesis.json is generated
	* Bootnode is started
	* Miner is started
	* Basic contract is written into the blockchain
	* enode address is exposed
	* contract wallet is exposed

#### Administrator commands
* Get address of own account
```eth.accounts[0]```
* Check balance
```web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(ACCOUNTADDRESS), "ether")```
* Unlock account before making the transaction
```personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0], ‘geslo’);```
* Send ether to another wallet
```eth.sendTransaction({from: "FROMACCOUNTADDRESS", to: "TOACCOUNTADDRESS", value: web3.toWei(ETHERVALUE,”ether"), gas: 500000})```
* Instantiate a js object for calling the contract
```var contract = eth.contract(ABI).at(CONTRACTADDRESS);```
* Change ownership of contract
```contract.transferOwnership.sendTransaction("TOACCOUNTADDRESS", {from: FROMACCOUNTADDRESS})```


### User (voter)
#### Miner
The purpose of user becoming a miner is to ensure that transactions are validated by multiple nodes, so the certainty of the system is increased. 

##### Instructions:
* ```apt-get install git```
* ```git clone https://github.com/danesjenovdan/humans.vote.git```
* ```cd humans.vote```
* ```chmod +x setup.sh```
* ```./setup.sh```
* When promted for the IP, enter the IP or domain name of the main party server, where enode information is available.
* When prompted for the wallet address enter your wallet address, that was generated in the mobile application. 
  * This will save any mined resources into your wallet.
  * Private key is not needed for mining into your account, however if you plan to use your node to send resources, voting (sending transactions) or for any other purpose involving use of your wallet you will need to install your private key into eth-data/keystore/.
  * If you do not enter an address one will be automatically generated for you. In this case you will be prompted to enter password for the private key.
 * When prompted if this is main node, enter "n" for no.
